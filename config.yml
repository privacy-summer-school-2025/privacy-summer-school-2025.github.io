      bio: "Vanessa Teague's research focuses on election security and verification. In 2023 she received the IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice (with Stark, Blom and Lindeman) for her work on Risk Limiting Audits for preferential elections, which will now run in election audits in the State of Colorado. She has also made significant contributions to the security of elections in Switzerland and Australia, having identified a series of serious problems in the cryptography of the Swiss and iVote Internet voting systems, which (at least in the Swiss case) were corrected as a result of the discovery. Her team at the university of Melbourne demonstrated re-identification of public Medicare-PBS data, which led to significant changes in Australian government data sharing. 
      </p><p>
      Her research work focuses on cryptographic analysis that has important implications for matters of public interest, particularly elections but also data privacy and other related topics. Her current main focus is Democracy Developers, which she founded in 2022 to translate these ideas into open-source software supporting Australian democracy."

            description: "Despite the pervasiveness of cloud platforms that facilitate outsourced storage and online collaborations, the basic requirement of end-to-end security is not yet available. As a consequence, we've witnessed many massive scales data breaches, frequently. This is in sharp contrast with communication, that there are long sequences of research and practical systems for end-to-end encrypted messaging available. 
            <br />
            In this talk, I will overview the key challenges causing this mismatch, and our recent efforts of providing end-to-end security for cloud storage and Git services with rigorous guarantees, while preserving full compatibility with existing infrastructure, and incurring only minimal overhead."

            description: |
              This talk presents privacy as a contextual and human-centered concept, exploring how people understand and manage it in digital environments. It introduces the APCO model linking antecedents, privacy concerns, and outcomes, and discusses frameworks such as CFIP and IUIPC for measuring privacy attitudes and behavior. The session explains factors influencing privacy decisions including awareness, culture, demographics, and personality, and examines the privacy paradox, where concerns do not always reduce disclosure. It also outlines the role of trust, risk, and perceived benefit in privacy calculus and emphasizes the need for privacy by design approaches that embed fairness, transparency, and user control in technology.

            title: "Attack Models for Differential Privacy"
            description: "Differential privacy (DP) is often regarded as a powerful privacy definition due to its strong attacker model and independence from prior knowledge. In this talk I will introduce some techniques for attack modelling and discuss how DP's attacker model sits in the landscape of these attacks. We will model other attackers and discuss how DP defences stack up against these. Finally, we will discuss strengths and weaknesses of the DP attack model, and identify gaps in the literature regarding privacy attacks."

            description: "Anonymous credentials are an important cryptographic concept, envisioned in the 1980s by Chaum, to enable privacy-friendly authentication. In recent years, they have experienced renewed interest, driven by new applications and increased attention from industry. In this talk, we will review the basic concept, explore different properties and types of such schemes, and examine current constructions of anonymous credentials. We will also take a look into the future — specifically the post-quantum setting — and discuss open research problems."

            description: |
              This talk explores how individuals manage privacy across social media, data-driven services, and digital ecosystems through adaptive boundary regulation. It introduces a five-part model addressing relationship, network, territorial, disclosure, and interactional boundaries, and explains user strategies such as filtering, blocking, withdrawal, and compromise. The session highlights challenges including the privacy paradox, imagined audiences, and context collapse, showing how these shape disclosure and control online. It also discusses privacy in healthcare and genetic data to illustrate stakeholder responsibilities and the need for multi-layered protection. The talk concludes with design principles for usable, trustworthy systems that uphold user agency, consent, and equitable data practices.
